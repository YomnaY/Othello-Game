# Othello Game in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic strategy board game Othello, also known as Reversi. Othello is played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board where two players compete to control the most territory by flipping their opponent's pieces.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against the computer using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm.
  
- **Game Setup**: The game starts with an initial setup placing two black disks and two white disks at the center of the board.

- **Gameplay**: Players take turns placing one disk on an empty square, with their assigned color facing up. If the placed disk encloses a straight line of the opponent's disks, those disks are flipped over to the player's color.

- **Alpha-Beta Algorithm**: Challenge the computer in single-player mode, where it employs the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to make strategic moves.

- **Rules Enforcement**: The game enforces the rules of Othello, ensuring that only legal moves are allowed.

- **End Game Detection**: The game detects when no more legal moves are possible, signaling the end of the game.

- **Win Determination**: At the end of the game, the player with the majority of their color showing on the board wins.
